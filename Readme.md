# NLP Workshop

This repository contains the sources from the NLP Workshop.

## Project

The Project under `example` contains two Files `Synonyms` and `Stanford`. They contain the two examples we developed during the workshop. 

`Synonyms` tries to guess POS of words in a sentence and replaces words by potential synonyms.

`Stanford` can recognize simple insults both in nominal and ajective form. It can additionally recognize arbitrary levels of negation.
